#### Introduction - Cookie Cats
- _Play and complete levels_ (Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle g ame where players complete a task and level up)
- _Encounter Gates_ (While players completes levels, they encounter gats after completing certain number of levels)
- _Wait at the gate_ (Gates force players to wait for sometime before they can play further or make in game purcahses)

#### Business Problem
- Even though Cookie Cats overall popularity is gorwing over time with players subscribing to try ou the game, but,
- Revenue from in-game purchases has been declining over time
- Total number of active players are also declining with players uninstalling the game after playing for few days

#### Project objectives
 _Business Objective_ 
 ncrease YoY revenue from game purcahses by increasing retention rate of gamers <br>

 _Hypothesis_ 
- Company CEO believes that players are churning because the first gate encountered at level 30 is too early which forces players to wait before they can proceed further in the game <br>
- In order to increase player retention rate, developers ran AB -test by moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 for some players <br>
• i.e., group A would encounter the gate at level 30
• And group B would encounter the gate at level 40
